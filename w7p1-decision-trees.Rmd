# Agenda 

* Overview of CART models

* Finding an optimal tree - complexity parameter

* Feature interpretation (quickly)

---
# Overview
* Non-parametric (do not make any distributional assumptions)

* Use splitting rules to divide features into non-overlapping regions, where the cases within each region are similar

* Basically the stepping stone for more complex models - generally don't work great on their own.

---
# Classification
* Decision trees are often easiest to think of, initially, through a classification problem
* Think about the titanic dataset - did passengers aboard survive?

---
# An example from the titanic

---
# Some terminology
![](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/images/decision-tree-terminology.png)

Note the leaf node is also called the terminal node

---
# Splitting rules
* .b[C]lassification .b[a]nd .b[r]egression .b[t]rees (CART)
  - Partition training data into homogeneous subgroups through recursive splitting (yes/no) until some criterion is reached 
  - Recursive because each split depends on prior splits

--
* At each node, find the "best" partition
  - search all possible splits on all possible variables

--
* How to define best?
  - Regression
      + SSE: $\Sigma_{R1}(y_i - c_1)^2 + \Sigma_{R2}(y_i - c_2)^2$
          * $c$ is the prediction (mean of cases in the region), which starts as a constant and is updated
          * $R$ is the region
  - Classification
      + Cross-entropy or Gini impurity (default)

---
# Gini impurity

* [Gini impurity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning#Gini_impurity) is not the same thing as the [Gini coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient) (this was very confusing for me)

* Default measure of lack of fit used by `rpart`. 


--
For a two class situation:

$$
D_i = 1 - P(c_1)^2 - P(c_2)^2
$$

where $P(c_1)$ and $P(c_2)$ are the probabilities of being in Class 1 or 2, respectively, for node $i$

---
For a multi-class solution

$$
D_i = 1 - \Sigma(p_i)^2
$$

In either case:
* When $D = 0$, the node is "pure" (perfect classification)
* When $D = 0.5$, the node is random (flip a coin)


---
# A couple examples
* Say your terminal node has 75%  in one class, for a binary decision. The Gini index would be

.left[
$$
\begin{aligned}
D &= 1 - (0.75^2 + 0.25^2) \\\
D &= 1 - (0.5625 + 0.0625) \\\
D &= 1 - 0.625 \\\
D &= 0.375
\end{aligned}
$$

]

---
# 90%

$$
\begin{aligned}
D &= 1 - (0.90^2 + 0.10^2) \\
D &= 1 - (0.81 + 0.01) \\
D &= 1 - 0.82 \\
D &= 0.18
\end{aligned}
$$

### Take home message - lower values mean better classifications

# Replicating the book
### Generate some data
```{r generate-sin-data}
n <- 200 # number of data points
x <- seq(0, 3.5, length.out = n)
a <- 5
b <- 2
error <- rnorm(n)
amp <- 4

# generate data and calculate "y"
set.seed(1)
y <- a*sin(b*x)+error*amp 
```

---

```{r plot-sin}
library(tidyverse)

sin_df <- tibble(x = x, y = y, truth = a*sin(b*x))
ggplot(sin_df, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(y = truth))
```


---
# Fit a simple model - one split

```{r decision-tree}
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)

mean(sin_df$y)

stump <- rpart(y ~ x, 
               data = sin_df,
               control = list(maxdepth = 1)) # limit tree depth #<< 
```

---
```{r stump-summary}
summary(stump)
```

---
# View the tree

```{r view-stump, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 8}
rpart.plot(stump)
```

---
# Visualize the split

```{r one-splt, fig.height = 5}
sin_df %>%
  mutate(pred = predict(stump)) %>%
ggplot(aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(y = truth)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = pred), color = "red")
```

---
# More complicated
* Note that we only have one predictor - but we can use that predictor multiple times

* Let's specify it again with two splits

```{r twosplit}
twosplit <- rpart(y ~ x, 
                  data = sin_df,
                  control = list(maxdepth = 2))
```

---
# View tree
```{r twosplit-tree}
rpart.plot(twosplit)

```

---
# Visualize two splits

```{r two-splt, fig.height = 5}
sin_df %>%
  mutate(pred = predict(twosplit)) %>%
ggplot(aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(y = truth)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = pred), color = "red")
```

---
# More complicated
Let's try with 10 splits

```{r tensplit}
tensplit <- rpart(y ~ x, 
                  data = sin_df,
                  control = list(minsplit = 0,
                                 cp = 0,
                                 maxdepth = 10))
```

Notice I've changed the complexity parameter, `cp`, to be 0, which will force it to grow a full tree (more on this in a bit)

---
```{r tensplit-tree}
rpart.plot(tensplit)
```

---

```{r ten-splt}
sin_df %>%
  mutate(pred = predict(tensplit)) %>%
ggplot(aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(y = truth)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = pred), color = "red")
```

---
# Tree depth
* The above probably leaves you thinking... how deep should I grow the trees?
  + Super deep - likely to overfit (high variance)
  + Super shallow - likely to underfit (high bias)



--
### Two primary approaches

* Stop the tree early
* Grow the tree deep, then prune it back


---
# Stopping early
Two primary approaches: 

* Limit the depth
* Limit the *n* size within a terminal node

---

---
# Pruning
* Tree is grown to a great depth, increasing the likelihood that important interactions in the data are captured.
* The large tree is "pruned" to a smaller subtree that captures (ideally) only the meaningful variation in the data.



--
### Cost complexity
* Typically denoted $\alpha$, the cost complexity introduces a penalization to the SSE (discussed earlier).

$$
SSE + \alpha\mid{T}\mid
$$

where $T$ is the number of terminal nodes/leafs

---
# Cost complexity

* The equation on the previous slide is .red[minimized] and, for a given $\alpha$, we identify (from the large tree) a subtree with the lowest penalized error.

* There is a clear association between this penalization and lasso regression.

* $\alpha$ is typically determined via grid search with cross-validation
  - smaller penalties = more complex trees
  - larger penalties = smaller trees

* When pruning a tree, the reduction in the SSE must be larger than the cost complexity penalty.

---
## What about for classification problems?
The basic structure is the same - split the predictor space into regions, make predictions based on the most prominent class

```{r iris}
class <- rpart(Species ~ Sepal.Length + Sepal.Width, 
               data = iris,
               method = "class")
```

Notice I've added `method = class` to specify it as a classification problem. If `y` is a factor it will do this automatically, but good to be specific.

---
```{r class-tree}
rpart.plot(class)
```

---
```{r iris-regions, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 8}
preds <- tibble(Prediction = c("Setosa", 
                               "Versicolor", 
                               "Setosa", 
                               "Versicolor",
                               "Virginica"),
                xmins = c(-Inf, -Inf, 5.5, 5.5, 6.2),
                xmaxs = c(5.5, 5.5, 6.2, 6.2, Inf),
                ymins = c(2.8, -Inf, 3.1, -Inf, -Inf),
                ymaxs = c(Inf, 2.8, Inf, 3.1, Inf))

ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_point(aes(shape = Species,
                 color = Species)) +
  geom_rect(aes(fill = Prediction, 
                xmin = xmins, 
                xmax = xmaxs, 
                ymin = ymins, 
                ymax = ymaxs), 
            color = "gray40",
            data = preds,
            alpha = 0.3,
            inherit.aes = FALSE)
```

# An applied example
* Let's look at the Kaggle data science bowl data again

```{r load-kaggle-data}
train <- read_csv(
    here::here("data", "data-science-bowl-2019", "train.csv"),
    n_max = 7e4 # Limit cases for speed of producing these slides
  ) %>%
  select(-event_data)

train_labels <- read_csv(
  here::here("data", "data-science-bowl-2019", "train_labels.csv")
)
```


---
# Inspect the keys

```{r inspect-keys}
train_labels %>%
  count(game_session, installation_id) %>%
  filter(n > 1)

train %>%
  count(game_session, installation_id) %>%
  filter(n > 1)
```

---
# Join the data

```{r join-data}
k_train <- left_join(train, train_labels)

# check join is as expected
nrow(train); nrow(k_train)
```

---
# Select only vars in test data

```{r select-vars}
model_set <- k_train %>%
  select(event_count, event_code, game_time, title, world, 
         accuracy_group) %>%
  drop_na(accuracy_group)
model_set
```

---
# Splits
Initial split, extract training data, create $k$-fold CV object.

```{r initial_split}
library(tidymodels)
splt <- initial_split(model_set)
train <- training(splt)
cv <- vfold_cv(train)
```

---
# Develop a simple recipe

```{r recipe}
rec <- recipe(accuracy_group ~ ., data = train) %>% 
  step_mutate(accuracy_group = as.factor(accuracy_group))
rec
```

---
# Set model specification
* set arbitrary cost complexity parameter and minimum n
```{r model_spec}
mod_random1 <- decision_tree() %>% 
  set_mode("classification") %>% 
  set_engine("rpart") %>% 
  set_args(cost_complexity = 0.01, min_n = 5) 
```


---
# Fit the arbitrary model
* Fit it to the full training set, just to get a feel for it
```{r k-fold-arbitrary}
m01 <- fit(mod_random1, accuracy_group ~ ., prep(rec) %>%  juice())

acc_check <- tibble(
    truth = prep(rec) %>%  juice() %>%  pull(accuracy_group),
    estimate = predict(m01$fit, type = "class")
  )
accuracy(acc_check, truth, estimate)

# View the tree
Five splits
```{r view-m0-tree1}

# Try different hyperparameters
```{r m0-update}
mod_random2 <- decision_tree() %>%

--
```{r include = FALSE}
splits <- m02$fit$cptable[ ,"nsplit"]
```

The second model is really overfit. In fact, it has .b[`r splits[length(splits)]`] splits!

---
# Tune hyperparameters
* Three different hyperparameters:
  + `cost_complexity()`: This is $\alpha$, what rpart calls `Cp`
  + `tree_depth()`: Maximum depth to which a tree should be grown
  + `min_n()`: Minimum number of data points in a terminal node


--
* Let's tune on `cost_complexity` and `min_n`, and let the tree depth be controlled by these values

--
```{r tune_model}
tune_model <- decision_tree() %>% 
  set_mode("classification") %>% 
  set_engine("rpart") %>% 
  set_args(cost_complexity = tune(), min_n = tune())
```

---
# Set grid

```{r set-grid}
grd <- grid_regular(cost_complexity(), min_n(), levels = c(10, 5))
grd
```

---
# Conduct tuning
Notice I'm adding additional metrics to evaluate here

```{r tune-grid, cache = TRUE}
metrics_eval <- metric_set(sensitivity, 
                           specificity, 
                           accuracy, 
                           roc_auc, 
                           bal_accuracy)

tictoc::tic()
tune_tree <- tune_grid(tune_model, 
                       rec, 
                       cv, 
                       grid = grd, 
                       metrics = metrics_eval)
tictoc::toc()
```
The `{tictoc}` code shows how long this model took to fit

---
# Check metrics
```{r show-best-metrics1}
show_best(tune_tree, "accuracy")
show_best(tune_tree, "roc_auc")
```

---
```{r show-best-metrics2}
show_best(tune_tree, "bal_accuracy")
```

I couldn't get this function to work for sensitivity/specificity.

---
# Look at sens/spec more manually

```{r sens-spec-echo, eval = FALSE}
tune_tree %>% 
  select(id, .metrics) %>% 
  unnest(.metrics) %>% 
  filter(.metric == "sens" | .metric == "spec") %>% 
  group_by(.metric) %>% 
  arrange(desc(.estimate)) %>% 
  slice(1:5)
```

---
```{r sens-spec-eval, echo = FALSE}
tune_tree %>% 
  select(id, .metrics) %>% 
  unnest(.metrics) %>% 
  filter(.metric == "sens" | .metric == "spec") %>% 
  group_by(.metric) %>% 
  arrange(desc(.estimate)) %>% 
  slice(1:5)
```

So a more complex model helps sensitivity (true positive rate), while a less complex model is best for specificity (true negative rate)

---
# Consider a specific set

```{r hyperparam-set}
tune_tree %>% 
  select(id, .metrics) %>% 
  unnest(.metrics) %>% 
  filter(cost_complexity == 0.001 & min_n == 2) %>% 
  select(-.estimator) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = .metric, values_from = .estimate)
```

Pretty poor sensitivity... 

---
# Finalize your decision
* I don't have an actual application here. If I were competing in the competition, I would max out Kappa (weighted; because that's the evaluation metric).

* In an actual application, my choice here may lead to big differences in decisions


--
* I'll go with balanced accuracy (average of sensitivity & specificity)

```{r best-bal_accuracy}
finalized_hp <- select_best(tune_tree, "bal_accuracy")
finalized_hp
```


---
# Finalize model
* Set new model with cross-validated hyper parameters
* Fit to full training data, predict on test set

```{r last_fit}
final_tree <- tune_model %>% 
  finalize_model(finalized_hp)

test_fit <- last_fit(final_tree, rec, splt, metrics = metrics_eval)
test_fit$.metrics
```

---
# View tree
`last_fit` doesn't save the model object, so need to refit first

```{r final-tree, cache = TRUE, fig.height = 5}

# Conclusions
* Decision trees have a lot of benefits
  - Non-parametric 
  - Simple trees are easily interpretable (follow a branch)
  - Can produce highly non-linear models (along with interactions)


--
* They also have a lot of drawbacks
  - Generally not the most predictive out-of-sample
  - Can produce highly non-linear models


--
* We'll extend this discussion next class to models that build ensembles of trees
